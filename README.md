# Compressible-Flow-Calculator

The purpose of these MatLab functions are to take the place of tables detailing the relationship between different values of a compressible flow. 
The three files include the tables for a Normal Shock, Prandtl-Meyer Expansion, and the Theta Beta Mach Relationship. 
MatLab doesn't allow a lot of special inputs to functions or setting a certain input as a certain variable. So I have opted to just have each function take in all the possible variables and the user just has to set the ones they will not use as zero. For the Normal Shock and Prandtl-Meyer Expansion functions this will mean that only one input will be non-zero. In the Theta Beta Mach function, two values will be non-zero.
I hope these functions help you in setting up complex compressible flows.
